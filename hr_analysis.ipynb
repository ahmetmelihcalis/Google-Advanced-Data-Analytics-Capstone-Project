    "This project serves as the capstone for the Google Advanced Data Analytics Certificate. It applies the skills learned throughout the course to a real-world business scenario at Salifort Motors, a fictional alternative energy vehicle manufacturer.\n",

    "Salifort Motors faces a significant challenge with employee retention. The senior leadership team has tasked the data analytics department with analyzing recent employee data to understand the key drivers of attrition.\n",

    "The primary goal of this project is to construct a predictive model that can identify employees who are likely to leave the company. This model will provide the Human Resources (HR) department with actionable insights to develop targeted retention strategies, ultimately reducing turnover costs and preserving valuable institutional knowledge.\n",
